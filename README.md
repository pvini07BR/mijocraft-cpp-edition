# how 2 compile 4 windows
First you need a GCC compiler (I use the [TDM-GCC compiler](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/download/)).

Then CD to the src folder with an Makefile, and type "make" there. It should work, I guess.

# how 2 compile 4 linux
there is an compileLinux.sh bash script on the src file, but i'm not sure if it really works.

# Remember, i will update this better in the future.
i know this readme.md sucks
